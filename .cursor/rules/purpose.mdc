# Split

This project is an **offline-first PWA** designed to help users create sessions, add elements with custom attributes, and distribute those elements into groups based on constraints.

### Core Features
- **Session Management**
  - Create, edit, and delete sessions
  - Store session data locally using IndexedDB (Dexie.js)

- **Element & Attribute Management**
  - Add elements (e.g., students, participants) to sessions
  - Define custom attributes (enum or numeric, optional or required)
  - Assign attributes to each element

- **Group Distribution**
  - Randomly distribute elements into a defined number of groups
  - Apply constraints to balance groups by:
    - Enum attributes (e.g., gender balance)
    - Numeric attributes (e.g., average score balance)
  - Allow manual adjustments via drag & drop

- **Visualization & Export**
  - Display group composition in a clean UI
  - Visualize distributions with charts
  - Export results to CSV or PDF

- **PWA Capabilities**
  - Fully offline-capable with service worker
  - Add to Home Screen support
  - Persistent storage using IndexedDB

### Example Use Case
A teacher can create a session for a class, add students as elements, assign gender and average grades as attributes, and generate 6 balanced groups where:
- Gender distribution is uniform
- Group averages are evenly balanced
